# Linear Regression Health Costs Calculator

## Overview
This project aims to predict healthcare costs using a linear regression algorithm. We will be utilizing Google's Colaboratory for the development of this project. 

## Getting Started

1. **Access the Notebook**:  
   Click on this [link to the Google Colaboratory notebook](<insert_link_here>). 
   
2. **Create a Copy**:  
   Once in the notebook, create a copy either in your own Google account or download it locally for modifications.

3. **Link Sharing**:  
   If you are submitting a link to your Google Colaboratory notebook, ensure to enable link sharing for "anyone with the link" so that the reviewers can access it.

## Project Details

### Objective
The main goal of this project is to accurately predict healthcare costs based on various attributes of individuals in a given dataset.

### Dataset
We will be provided with a dataset that contains information about different individuals, including their healthcare costs. The total dataset will be split into training and test datasets as follows:
- **Training Dataset**: 80% of the data
- **Test Dataset**: 20% of the data

#### Important Note:
- The "expenses" column in the dataset represents the healthcare costs we are aiming to predict.

### Steps to Follow

1. **Import Necessary Libraries**:  
   The first two cells of this notebook will include the necessary imports and load the dataset.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Convert any categorical data into numerical format for modeling.
   - Split the dataset into `train_dataset` and `test_dataset` (80% / 20%).

3. **Label Separation**:
   - Use the "expenses" column to create two new datasets:
     - `train_labels` (the expenses for the training dataset)
     - `test_labels` (the expenses for the test dataset)

4. **Model Training**:
   - Construct a regression model using an appropriate library (such as TensorFlow or Scikit-learn).
   - Train the model using `train_dataset` and the corresponding `train_labels`. 

5. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Run the final cell to assess the performance of the model using the unseen `test_dataset`. 
   - Ensure the model's evaluation returns a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of under 3500.

6. **Results Visualization**:
   - The final cell will also graph the predicted expenses against the actual expenses from `test_labels` to visualize model performance.

## Additional Resources
We are currently in the process of finalizing interactive instructional content for our machine learning curriculum. In the meantime, please feel free to explore video challenges in the certification program and seek external learning resources as you would in a real-world project scenario.

## Submission Instructions
Once you have completed your project and achieved a passing score on the evaluation test, submit the link to your Google Colaboratory notebook or your local version here: [Submission Link]. 

Make sure that your notebook is sharable so that it can be reviewed effectively.

Happy coding, and good luck with your predictions!
